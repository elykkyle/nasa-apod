## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

A fun site I built that queries NASA's API for the Astronomy Picture of the Day. On load, the current day picture loads, and a date picker allows the user to choose any historical day they choose. Site is responsive using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Lessons Learned

This project gave me some good practice using fetch in JavaScript. I also learned a lot about Tailwind CSS and how it implements responsiveness.

## Optimizations (Backlog)

• Add support for video
• Prevent user from picking date in future
• Style date picker
