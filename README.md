# NASA Picture of the Day

A simple page to grab NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day using [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov).

This project gave me more practice using an API to get content, then updating DOM accordingly.

I also used this project to get some hands-on experience with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
